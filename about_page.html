	<h1><b>About this Blog</b></h1>

	<p>
	Welcome to the worst possible idea ever. Two best friends have decided to blog. The idea came after being belligerent at a rave (shout out Porter Robinson)… So its kind of our idea from a spirit journey. Elijah and I have been fighting for years about what shoe is better, BAPE Vs Supreme, and judging everyone’s fit. So now we decided to put our skills of maxing out our credit cards, spending $1,000.00 a day and watching YouTube sneaker head videos to good use. We're purely hoping that someone from Complex News will look at our content and get us jobs, but until then we will do our best to please our few fans (for now). This first post is more about us. Soooooo here it goes.

	Hi my name is Tyler Trinidad,
	</p>
	<p>
	I love brands, I’m a brand whore. I am obsessed with the idea of all things clothing, shoes, and accessories. From fine fashion of Louis V, MCM bags, and Versace, to a sick Primitive x Dragon ball collab I can buy at a mainland store near my house. I love it all. I can sadly say I have spent at least half of my life earnings on possibly shoes and clothes. So who better than this idiot to tell you what he thinks is cool or not. I can’t wait to see how big this project comes. (Estimating this lasts 5 to 6 months but who knows). I really look forward to this and can’t wait till a 15 year old on the internet makes fun of us.

	Hello my name is Elijah Caluya,
	</p>
	<p>
	I graduated from the University of Oregon with a degree in Computer Science and Psychology and wanted to find a way to utilize the skills I learned into a project that I am passionate about. This online blog is the product of my love for the sneaker community, hype culture, and web design. I am mainly a Jordan head but I also have great respect for the rich history of Nike SB Dunks and the newer innovations of Kanye's Adidas Yeezy line. In terms of clothing, I gravitate towards the styles of sktaeboard brands like Supreme and Palace because I used to skate as a kid although I was never really any good. In short, we are just two Asian hypebeasts that wanted to put their thoughts about an expensive hobby onto the internet for the world to see.

	So here it begins, our first baby steps. Who knows what is in store. All we have to do is believe and our dreams will come true. Thank you for Cumming on this journey with us. As we sadly spend more of our own money to help our fucked up habits.
