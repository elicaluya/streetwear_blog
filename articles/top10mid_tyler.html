	<h1><b><u>Tyler's Top 10 Sneakers of the Year So Far</u></b></h1>
	<h3>7/15/2019</h3>

	<br>

	<p>2019 has given us a wide range of fire kicks and of course we had to rank them based on our personal opinion. These choices were kind of hard to make since so many brands were pumping out large amounts of sneakers especially from Yeezy and Jordan Brand. Tyler and I have pretty different attitudes when it comes to sneakers so I am sure that the majority of my list will be different from his. Most likely this list will change by the end of the year but here is a solid list of my favorites that have released by the time I have written this article.</p>

	<p>*All images are from Stockx.com and clicking on the images provides a link to their respective stockx page.</p>

	<br>
	
	<h2>10) New Balance OMN1S</h2>
		<a href="https://stockx.com/new-balance-omn1s-kawhi-leonard-2-way" target="_blank">
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/New-Balance-OMN1S-Kawhi-Leonard-2-Way/Images/New-Balance-OMN1S-Kawhi-Leonard-2-Way/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1562948358&w=1000"
		alt="New Balance OMN1S" style="width: 30%"></a>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	So a surprise start for number ten. This shoe is possibly the sleeper shoe of the year. Kawaii did his thing in these and ended up winning a damn title. My reason I put this in here is really only for the following: The brand is back. It was nothing before Kawaii signed, people maybe wanted some 999 or some 997's but now... New Balance is back and the face is the KLAW!!!
	</p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>9) Jordan 4 Bred</h2>
		<a href="https://stockx.com/air-jordan-4-retro-bred-2019" target="_blank">
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Air-Jordan-4-Retro-Bred-2019/Images/Air-Jordan-4-Retro-Bred-2019/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1555622524&w=1000"
		alt="Jordan 4 Bred" style="width: 30%"></a>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	Low-key its whatever. Same OG sneaker (you will learn how I feel about OG's). It was pretty dope that its been 30 years since the original drop but yeah, even though to some it's a grail its not something I am really into and that's why it's my number 9.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>8) Nike x Supreme Air Tailwind 4</h2>
		<a href="https://stockx.com/nike-air-max-tailwind-4-supreme-white" target="_blank">
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Nike-Air-Max-Tailwind-4-Supreme-White/Images/Nike-Air-Max-Tailwind-4-Supreme-White/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1553893473&w=1000"
		alt = "Nike x Supreme Air Tailwind 4" style="width: 30%"></a>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	A very interesting collab here but still pretty nice. (Anything with supreme is dope though) The brand's team effort on the Air Tailwind 4 has some color and texture to keep things fresh. Overall a pretty clean shoe in my opinion.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>7) Nike Adapt BB</h2>
		<a href="https://stockx.com/nike-adapt-bb-black-pure-platinum" target="_blank">
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Nike-Adapt-BB-Black-Pure-Platinum/Images/Nike-Adapt-BB-Black-Pure-Platinum/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1551049122&w=1000"
		alt="Nike Adapt BB" style="width: 30%"></a>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	Power acing!!! That's all I got to say. Also that price being way cheaper than last year's hyper adapts is nice as well.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>6) Adidas ZX 4000 4D</h2>
		<a href="https://stockx.com/adidas-zx-4000-futurecraft-4d-grey-one" target="_blank">
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/adidas-ZX-4000-Futurecraft-4D-Grey-One/Images/adidas-ZX-4000-Futurecraft-4D-Grey-One/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1551742749&w=1000"
		alt ="Adidas ZX 4000 4D" style="width: 30%"></a>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	Adidas' 4D midsole is one of the more craziest forms of technology to make its way into the sneaker community recently. Could this be the future for Adidas?
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>5) Nike x Off-White Air Max 90</h2>
		<a href="https://stockx.com/nike-air-max-90-off-white-desert-ore" target="_blank">
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Nike-Air-Max-90-Off-White-Desert-Ore/Images/Nike-Air-Max-90-Off-White-Desert-Ore/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1547152762&w=1000"
		alt="Nike x Off-White Air Max 90" style="width: 30%"></a>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	Nike and Off-White's collaboration has been crazy so far, but the Air Max 90 from this february is solid evidence that it hasn't lost steam. Virgil is a god and he continues his greatness not only with this but with Louis V as well.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>4) Adidas Yeezy Boost 700 Inertia</h2>
		<a href="https://stockx.com/adidas-yeezy-boost-700-inertia" target="_blank">
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Adidas-Yeezy-Boost-700-Inertia/Images/Adidas-Yeezy-Boost-700-Inertia/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1551991286&w=1000"
		alt = "Adidas Yeezy Boost 700 Inertia" style="width: 30%"></a>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	Yeezy Boost 700 - all shades of grey with a subtle pop of color - is something that only the wave runners have. This is a really nice colorway and for sure a drip. Also a lot of sizes are below retail on stockx and grailed.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>3) Sacai x Nike LD Waffle</h2>
		<a href="https://stockx.com/nike-ld-waffle-sacai-green-multi" target="_blank">
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Nike-LD-Waffle-Sacai-Green-Multi/Images/Nike-LD-Waffle-Sacai-Green-Multi/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1554843668&w=1000"
		alt="Sacai x Nike LD Waffle" style="width: 30%"></a>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	I love them to death, but not the current ones out. Being a fan of more monochromatic colorways like the white and black that drop later in the year will be a for sure cop for me. The two current colors are saucy but can't wait to see what the future holds for this brand.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>2) Bape x Adidas Ultra Boost</h2>
		<a href="https://stockx.com/adidas-ultra-boost-4-bape-camo" target="_blank">
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Adidas-Ultra-Boost-4-Bape-Camo/Images/Adidas-Ultra-Boost-4-Bape-Camo/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1549047492&w=1000"
		alt="Bape x Adidas Ultra Boost" style="width: 30%"></a>
	<p></p>
	<p>	
	My two favorite things, Bape and Ultra Boosts. This was fire and I couldn't wait to get a pair. Both colorways are great and in 2nd place for the current collabs between the two companies:
	</p>
	<p>1) NMD</p>
	<p>2) Ultra Boost</p>
	<p>3) Dame 4</p>
	<br>

	<h2>1) Jordan 1 Retro High Travis Scott</h2>
		<a href="https://stockx.com/air-jordan-1-retro-high-travis-scott" target="_blank">
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Air-Jordan-1-Retro-High-Travis-Scott/Images/Air-Jordan-1-Retro-High-Travis-Scott/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1550180948&w=1000"
		alt="Jordan 1 Retro High Travis Scott" style="width: 30%"></a>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	GRAIL!!!! Travis Scott's partnership with Jordan has been a fan favorite from the absolute start with those saucey Jordan 4's and this pair of 1's shows that it's still going strong. Travis might be up there soon with the one and only Ye as the top artist/designer.
