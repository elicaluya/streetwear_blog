	<h1><b>Jordan 4 Union Thoughts/Opinions</b></h1>

		Jordan is back collaborating with LA based brand, Union, and the results have been far from normal. From the leaked images to people changing their minds  when they have them in hand, this shoe has received every single type of criticism you can think of. At first people were very skeptical and called this shoe a joke of a collab after seeing those low quality leaked pictures. Then slowly people's minds started to change as there were better pictures released and more celebrities had them on feet. Once they released and people had them in hand, people started flip flopping their opinions quickly as people started to hear out Union's Chris Gibb's reasoning and story behind the shoe.

		First off, it was not uncommon to see people compare this shoe to Union's first collab with Jordan brand, the Union Jordan 1, as that shoe is highly coveted. I was guilty of this too as I really like the Union Jordan 1 and was very hyped when I heard that they were going to release a second collab, but this time with my favorite Jordan model, the Jordan 4. Personally, when I first saw those leaked images I was kind of disappointed because I really did not know what I was looking at and if those pictures were to be the final version of the shoe. I did not really hate the shoe at first but I definitely was not in love with it until I saw more pictures. I think it was when I saw Jerry Lorenzo with them on is when I thought these shoes could be hot. Then I learned that you could unstitch the tongue and I started to like the shoe even more as that extra layer of customizability really intrigued me. Similar to how the Off White 5s allow you to cut the holes out in them, I felt this was in the same light to really make the shoe your own.

		When it came to release time, I was lucky enough to hit on the first release on the Union website and scored a pair of the Off Noir colorway. I must commend Union on their bot protection as they literally made the user type in the answer to a question to purchase the shoes, which is something I feel like no bots were ready for or were able to fill in (What color is an orange lol). Looking back, I should have probably gone for the Guava Ice colorway of the shoe since it is the more exclusive colorway but I am happy that I was able to hit on one of them. Also, I thought the whole collab was done pretty well as the other shoes (Zoom 92 and Delta Mid) and the apparel were really nice looking. I would have gone for the hoodies but they were a little too expensive for me even though they looked super clean.

		So I have had the shoes for about a month by now and I haven't really worn them since the pandemic doesn't really allow for a lot of moments to wear nice shoes out. But I have pretty much stared at the shoe this whole time like a wuss because I am too scared to wear them right now. In the time that I have being carefully staring at these shoes, I start to appreciate the shoe a lot more and want to wear frequently once the pandemic ends. My first impressions about the shoe were mainly about the box design as I think it looks incredibly clean with a cream colored lid with Michael Jordan's hands on it and the image of MJ as the tissue paper. Also, the hang tag is in this really nice shade of blue that goes well with the muted color of the blue near the ankle of the shoe. Another thing to note about my first impressions about the Union Jordan 4 is that yellowed sole as it definitely gives a vintage and worn vibe which is something I have come to appreciate.

		Now for the meat and potatoes of the shoe. Most notably, the mesh toe box and upper seems to pair pretty nicely with the sudede of the Jordan 4 as I imagine that these shoes will not crease easily. Details like these are really what makes me like a shoe more and want to give it an even more aged look. The suede is good when compared to 2019's Black Cement 4 but I wouldn't say it is highest quality suede like on a New Balance shoe. I got a good look at the folded down tongue and even if you decide to leave the tongue down, I like that the stitching is yellow like the Jordan 1 as it is a very subtle and nice detail that matches the UN/LA tag underneath the wing tip. Speaking of the wing tips, the filled in take as opposed to the original style was something that I was skeptical at first when I saw images, but seeing them in person makes them really nice.

		Overall, I really like this shoe and plan to where it more when the pandemic is over. My plan is to swap out the stock black laces and put in the yellow laces that they came with. I do not plan to cut the stitching on the tongue to flip it up because this tongue down look has really grown on me. Also, I think that the tongue up looks better on the Guava Ice colorway because its a white tongue and the tag seems to pop a lot more on it. On the Off Noir pair it seems less subtle. I think this shoe will age nicely whether or not you decide to wear it heavily or not and I think will have more people come to appreciate how different it is down the line. This Union and Jordan collab definitely started out as a head scratcher but hearing about the inspiration behind it and having the shoe in hand makes me appreciate the collab even more.
