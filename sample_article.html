	This is the article written for the date above. This is a sample article meant to just take up space and testout functionality and the use of space on the page. In order to fill out space, I will fill the rest of the page with diaaogue from the show "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" from the episode "Dee made a smut film":

	ll right, what about this one? You know, I had a dream about, um, you know, boiled eggs.
	So, I, uh Okay.
	What do thewhat do the eggs represent? Eggs, you know? Like, uh from a chicken.
	Just eggs? No.
	Charlie, you're not getting it.
	I need you to draw something that's profound, you know? That comes from someplace deep.
	But is also childlike and stupid, to prove my point.
	Hey, bro, uh, maybe stop telling me what to do all the time, you know? 'Cause if you tell me what to do, then, like, you know, that's, like, I got, like, a lame, kind of square dude telling me what to do, you know? And that's not really where art comes from.
	Okay, you And so I'm gonna draw eggs that represent eggs, bro.
	And it's gonna it's gonna be hella cool, man.
	You're gonna like these eggs.
	Can I ask you a question? Do you do you want to sell this art or not? Bro, is this about making money for you or is it about proving your point? Like, I don't even know what it is, man.
	It's becoming about both for me.
	I don't know what it's becoming for you.
	Come on, man.
	I'm ripping this up.
	I'm ripping this up.
	That's it.
	Bro, stop ripping up my art, man! Get in there! Hey.
	You stink! Ugh.
	I found him turning tricks in the scrap metal yard.
	Good news, Charlie.
	We're gonna use Cricket now.
	Oh.
	Use me how? Use what part of me? Relax.
	You are gonna be the face of Charlie's art.
	What? Why, man? Because he's got, like, the worst life imaginable, and that's clearly what those people want.
	That's true, I do have the worst life.
	(chuckles) You know what, Cricks, why don't you come over here, why don't you tell Charlie what to draw.
	Okay.
	Tell me wh I don't want to draw his drawings.
	No, Charlie, this is gonna work, all right? Just jump on board, jump on board.
	Okay, go ahead.
	All right, bro bro.
	Oh, all right, fine.
	Talk to me, brother.
	What's up? What is he doing? He's doing, like, a Grieco thing.
	Okay.
	Uh, all right.
	Well, what do you want to hear about? You want to hear about a dog orgy or when a cat bit off my toe? Dog orgy, brother.
	CRICKET: Dog orgy.
	Okay.
	This is going great.
	Okay, now, Frank, I need you to go talk to that gallery owner.
	Convince her to come to Paddy's for an art opening that we're gonna have here.
	Oh.
	You know? Flash a little cash.
	Pretend you're, like, a high-society art type.
	Oh, I got this.
	I-I used to hang with an art crowd in the '70s.
	I know these people.
	O-Okay.
	All right.
	But-but play it subtle, all right? Subtle.
	Yeah.
	Frank.
	Play it subtle.
	I got it.
	(whispers): Subtle.
	Hello! Hello? Ango Gablogian, the art collector.
	Charmed, I'm sure.
	Yes.
	I'm gonna invite you to a show.
	Okay.
	But first allow me to destroy your gallery.
	Bullshit.
	Bullshit.
	Derivative.
	That I love.
	I absolutely love.
	Um, that's just the air conditioner.
	I want it.
	It's everything.
	I mean, look at us.
	We're just air conditioners.
	I mean, after all, we're just walking around on the planet, breathing, conditioning the air.
	I condition it hot, that conditions it cold.
	I mean, it's symbiotic, no? No, it is.
	I mean, we're just the air conditioners walking around on this planet, screwing each other's brains out.
	So true.
