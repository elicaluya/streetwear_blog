	<h1>Elijah's Top 10 Sneakers of the Year So Far</h1>
	<h3>7/15/2019</h3>

	<br>

	<p>2019 has given us a wide range of fire kicks and of course we had to rank them based on our personal opinion. These choices were kind of hard to make since so many brands were pumping out large amounts of sneakers especially from Yeezy and Jordan Brand. Tyler and I have pretty different attitudes when it comes to sneakers so I am sure that the majority of my list will be different from his. Most likely this list will change by the end of the year but here is a solid list of my favorites that have released by the time I have written this article.</p>

	<p>All images are from Stockx.com</p>

	<br>
	
	<h2>10) Tom Sachs x Nikecraft Mars Yard Overshoe</h2>
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Nike-Mars-Yard-Overshoe-Tom-Sachs/Images/Nike-Mars-Yard-Overshoe-Tom-Sachs/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1546676540&w=1000"
		alt="Tom Sachs x Nikecraft mars Yard Overshoe" style="width: 30%">
	<p>
	This shoe is outrageous and for that reason alone it made this list. The whole execution of this shoe is wild from the actual shoe to the shoebox. What makes this shoe so unique is the giant waterproof bag that surrounds the mars yard shoe inside. What is also very cool about this release is the design of the shoebox and insoles as they are detailed with calculations and sketches of the whole design and creative process. If this shoe didn't look so ugly I would have put it higher on the list solely based on the innovation behind it.
	</p>

	<h2>9) Nike Zoom Terra Kiger 5 Off-White</h2>
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Nike-Zoom-Terra-Kiger-5-Off-White-White-W/Images/Nike-Zoom-Terra-Kiger-5-Off-White-White-W/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1562870752&w=1000"
		alt="Nike Zoom Terra Kiger 5 Off-White" style="width: 30%">
	<p>
	The Off white iteration of this running shoe takes inspiration from the track and field roots that Nike started from. What stands out to me the most are the rubber spikes that extend from the bottom of the sole and gives the shoe a very unique look. What also catches my eye is the very interesting lacing system mixed in with the Off-white aesthetic that Virgil Abloh's collab is known for.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>8) Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Black</h2>
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/adidas-Yeezy-Boost-350-V2-Black/Images/adidas-Yeezy-Boost-350-V2-Black/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1559748037&w=1000"
		alt = "Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Black" style="width: 30%">
	<p>
	Straight up, this colorway is clean. We have been waiting for a triple black colorway of the Yeezy 350 V2 and what we received was very nice. I was really sold on this colorway when I got them in hand and got a good look at the translucent stripe and the red detailing on the pull tab. it also seems like the latest iterations of the 350 V2's have a softer primeknit than the older ones, which gives it a more comfier fit. With a reflective version of this shoe, it is for sure a refreshing take on this mass released model.
	</p>

	<h2>7) Jordan 6 Retro Black Infrared</h2>
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Air-Jordan-6-Retro-Black-Infrared-2019/Images/Air-Jordan-6-Retro-Black-Infrared-2019/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1549058088&w=1000"
		alt="Jordan 6 Retro Black Infrared" style="width: 30%">
	<p>
	This is one of my favorite Jordans ever and I am really glad that the latest retro was executed nicely. From the lace locks to the nike air on the back, this shoe comes in a much better version than the previous iteration. What I like the most about this shoe is the darker shade of infrared as the 2014 version had a more pinkish version while this shade is a lot deeper and more true to the original version. With Michael Jordan winning his first championship in these shoes, it holds a large amount of nostalgic value to many consumers and collectors.

	<h2>6) Nike Air Max 90 Off-White Desert Ore</h2>
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Nike-Air-Max-90-Off-White-Desert-Ore/Images/Nike-Air-Max-90-Off-White-Desert-Ore/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1547152762&w=1000"
		alt ="Nike Air Max 90 Off-White Desert Ore" style="width: 30%">
	<p>
	Supposedly being the last release from The Off White x Nike collab, this shoe came with a very unique colorway to an already wild variation of the Air Max 90. The Air max 90 was one of my favorite shoes from the original "The 10" collection and this new colorway really made me like the shoe even more. What I like most about the shoe is that mango orange color on the swoosh and the extra laces that really give the shoe a nice pop. Mix that with the tan colorway and the Off White deconstructed aesthetic and you have yourself a very unique sneaker.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>5) Jordan 1 Retro High OG Defiant SB LA to Chicago</h2>
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Air-Jordan-1-SB-LA-To-Chicago/Images/Air-Jordan-1-SB-LA-To-Chicago/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1557777927&w=1000"
		alt="Jordan 1 Retro High OG Defiant SB LA to Chicago" style="width: 30%">
	<p>
	Definitely one of the shoes I really wanted to get my hands on, this familiar collab between Nike Sb and Jordan Brand gave us a super clean colorway that wears away into the classic Chicago colorway. What I like the most about these types of collabs is the fact that they not only encourage you to wear your shoe but to also skate in the shoe. Although I am not the greatest skater, I am a fan of skateboard culture and the influence it has had on streetwear and sneakers over the years. Overall, this is a very nice shoe with a vast amount of customization and versatility.

	<h2>4) Air Vapormax 2019 Cactus Plant Flea Market</h2>
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Nike-Air-VaporMax-2019-CPFM/Images/Nike-Air-VaporMax-2019-CPFM/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1559250102&w=1000"
		alt = "Air Vapormax 2019 Cactus Plant Flea Market" style="width: 30%">
	<p>
	The Cactus Plant Flea Market collab with the nike air vapormax takes a very different approach to the sneaker and adds interesting elements that create a truly unique shoe. My favorite part about the shoe has to be that 3D swoosh. I think that elevates the shoe to another level when it comes to re imagining a sneaker and the elements that it is made up of. The signature double smiley face found on the heel of each shoe is also a nice touch. With the Friends and Family pair having a light up sole, this sneaker is oozing with creative energy.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>3) Jordan 4 Retro Bred</h2>
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Air-Jordan-4-Retro-Bred-2019/Images/Air-Jordan-4-Retro-Bred-2019/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1555622524&w=1000"
		alt="Jordan 4 Retro Bred" style="width: 30%">
	<p>
	Whether you want to call it the Black Cement or Bred 4, you cannot deny that this Jordan is an absolute classic. With this latest retro having nike air on the heel instead of the jumpman, this sneaker returns in its true form. My only gripe about the shoe is that nike air placement is slightly off center, but other than that, the shoe is executed really nicely. Personally, this is one of my all time favorite Jordans to ever release and I am very happy to get my hands on this timeless sneaker. Not much else needs to be said on this, the shoe and the history behind it speaks for itself. 
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>2) Nike LD Waffle Sacai</h2>
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Nike-LD-Waffle-Sacai-Blue-Multi/Images/Nike-LD-Waffle-Sacai-Blue-Multi/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1552579822&w=1000"
		alt="Nike LD Waffle Sacai" style="width: 30%">
	<p>	
	This shoe really stood out to me as something that really pushed the boundaries just enough to make two really old and unappealing (to me personally) nike runners into a modern and creative twist. The execution on the shoe is super sick from the double swoosh and tongue to my personal favorite, the spoiler type fin at the heel. I think the design is so simplistic and yet so bold with the original colorways sporting such vibrant color blocking. Chitose Abe, Sacai's founder and creative director, had a vision of what she wanted this sneaker to look like and function and I think it was executed beautifully.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h2>1) Jordan 1 Retro High Travis Scott</h2>
		<img src="https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Air-Jordan-1-Retro-High-Travis-Scott/Images/Air-Jordan-1-Retro-High-Travis-Scott/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=90&updated_at=1550180948&w=1000"
		alt="Jordan 1 Retro High Travis Scott" style="width: 30%">
	<p>
	What else is there to be said about the Travis Scott Jordan 1. This shoe was executed incredibly well with the numerous details on the shoe including the backwards swoosh and the stamp on the heel. My favorite element of the shoe has to be the stash pocket because it draws inspiration from Chad Muska's signature shoe from eS, a brand that strikes a nostalgic chord in me. Even though the shoe is in a poop brown colorway, the Jordan 1 model is so versatile that this color blocking makes it look absolutely fire. Travis's ideas were very strong in this collaboration and definitely shines above the other sneakers that have released so far in 2019.
